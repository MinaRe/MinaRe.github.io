I am a Senior Machine Learning and Data Scientist at the Statistics and Data Science Department of LMU Munich. Currently, I am the teaching coordinator of the Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML) and lead the focus group Methods Beyond Supervised Learning at the Statistics Department of LMU Munich. 

Prior to joining LMU, I was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, Mass Generalâ€™s Hospital, Boston, in the group of Hiroyuki Yoshida. During that time, I was conducting research on probabilistic deep learning and robust representation learning for clinical data analysis. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Hasso-Plattner Institute (HPI), Potsdam University robust deep learning models for medical image analysis, advised by Prof. Christoph Meinel. I did my M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Computer Science, Shiraz University and my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering.



Research
------
My research interests include both technical and theoretical skills of machine learning with a focus on its transformative applications within the realm of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and healthcare:

* Learning with minimal supervision (semi-supervised learning, positive-unlabeled learning, self-supervised learning)
* Probabilistic machine learning (scoring rule, Bayesian neural networks, uncertainty estimation)
* Deep metric learning (geometry learning, contrastive learning, ranking)
* Generative models (GANs, diffusion, flow models)
