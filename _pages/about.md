I am a university lecturer and group leader at the Chair of Statistical Learning and Data Science, Department of Statistics, LMU Munich. Currently, I serve as the teaching coordinator for the Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML) and lead the "Methods Beyond Supervised Learning" focus group at LMU Munich's Statistics Department.

Before joining LMU, I was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School and Mass General Hospital in Boston, working with Hiroyuki Yoshida's group. During that time, I focused on probabilistic deep learning and robust representation learning for clinical data analysis. I earned my Ph.D. from the Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) at Potsdam University, where I conducted research on robust deep learning models for medical image analysis under the supervision of Prof. Christoph Meinel. I also hold an M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the Department of Computer Science, Shiraz University, and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering.



Research
------
My research interests include both technical and theoretical skills of machine learning with a focus on its transformative applications within the realm of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and healthcare:

* Learning with minimal supervision (semi-supervised learning, positive-unlabeled learning, self-supervised learning)
* Probabilistic machine learning (scoring rule, Bayesian neural networks, uncertainty estimation)
* Deep metric learning (geometry learning, contrastive learning, ranking)
* Generative models (GANs, diffusion, flow models)
