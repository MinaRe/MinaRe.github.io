I am a Senior Machine Learning and Data Scientist at Statistics and Data Science Department of LMU Munich. Currently, I am the teaching coordinator of the Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML) and lead the focus group Methods Beyond Supervised Learning at Statistics Department of LMU Munich. 

Prior to joining LMU, I was a research fellow at Harvard Medical School, Mass Generalâ€™s Hospital, Boston, in the group of Hiroyuki Yoshida. During that time, I was conducting research on probabilistic deep learning and robust representation learning for clinical data analysis. I obtained my Ph.D. from the Hasso-Plattner Institute (HPI), Potsdam University robust deep learning models for medical image analysis, advised by Prof. Christoph Meinel. I did my M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence at the Department of Computer Science, Shiraz University and Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Software Engineering.



Research
------
My research interests include both technical and theoretical skills of machine learning with a focus on its transformative applications within the realm of computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and healthcare:

* Learning with minimal supervision (semi-supervised learning, positive-unlabeled learning, self-supervised learning)
* Probabilistic machine learning (scoring rule, Bayesain neural networks, uncertainty estimation)
* Generative models (GANs, defusion, flow-models)
* Deep metric learning (geometry learning, contrastive learning, ranking)
